When using fixation durations to scale sequences each fixation is treated individually. This means that a high minimum scaling unit could cause significant rounding errors. For example, a fixation on area "A" for 15 seconds followed by a second fixation on area "A" for 25 seconds, would yield a sequence of AAA with a 10 second minimum scaling unit, having divide each fixation length by the minimum scaling unit. Each fixation is treated individually not in aggregate.
