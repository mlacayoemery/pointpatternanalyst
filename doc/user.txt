Introduction
Point Pattern (PoP) Analyst is a library of functions and classes created to make the analysis and visualization of point pattern data useable in a variety of other applications, particularly geographic information systems and sequence analysis programs.

Application Areas
PoP Analyst is useful for converting files ands coding data.

Install and Update
There are several options for installing and updating PoP Analyst. The prefeered method is to download the latest realease from http://pointpatternanalyst.googlecode.com. The download is available on the download page, which can be reached by click on the download tab. The avaiable downloads are compressed into ZIP format and must be unzipped before using, but require no additional setup. updating a download of SOM Analyst only requires downloading the latest release and unzipping it to the same folder as the older release, overwriting the old files.

The other option for downloading PoP Analyst is to use a SVN client to retrieve the repositroy from http://pointpatternanalyst.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/. (For more information on SVN see the appendix.) Unlike the ZIP of PoP Analyst, the PoP Analyst svn repositry no longer includes the shapefile classes needed, which must also be downloaded and is available from http://shapefile.googlecode.com. Updating PoP Analyst can be preformed by either calling the SVN update command or downloading a patch if available from the download page. Note the SVN repository is where revisions to PoP Analyst are immediately avaialable, and as such maybe unstable.

5.  Checout the repository at http://shapefile.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ to the folder called shp.
6.  Updates can be performed by calling the SVN update function on both the PoP Analyst folder and the shp folder.

Standalone GUI
The standalone GUI for PoP Analyst requires an additonal library called WxPython, if you do not plan on using the standalone gui you do not need it.
1.  Go to http://www.wxpython.org/
2.  Select the download link and choose the appropriate version for your system.
